## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze product performance metrics through a comprehensive dashboard for an e-commerce business. Using Python for data processing and visualization, I analyzed key performance indicators

**Skills demonstrated:**

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Statistical analysis
* Data visualization
* Dashboard creation
* Business intelligence
* Python programming (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Dataset

For this analysis, I used the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset by Olist, which contains information on 100,000+ orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. The dataset includes information on:

* Orders
* Products
* Customers
* Reviews
* Sellers

This rich dataset allowed me to track meaningful product performance metrics and user behavior patterns.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

I focused on these critical metrics to evaluate product performance:

1. **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Unique customers visiting the platform daily
2. **Sales Trends**: Daily revenue with moving averages
3. **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of sessions that resulted in purchases
4. **Product Category Performance**: Revenue and order volume by category
5. **Customer Retention**: Percentage of customers who return to make additional purchases
6. **Average Delivery Time**: Days between order and delivery

## Data Processing Pipeline

I developed a robust data processing pipeline to prepare the data for analysis:

```python
# Sample code snippet from my data processing pipeline
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Load datasets
orders = pd.read_csv('olist_orders_dataset.csv')
order_items = pd.read_csv('olist_order_items_dataset.csv')
products = pd.read_csv('olist_products_dataset.csv')
customers = pd.read_csv('olist_customers_dataset.csv')

# Convert date columns to datetime
date_columns = ['order_purchase_timestamp', 'order_approved_at', 
                'order_delivered_carrier_date', 'order_delivered_customer_date', 
                'order_estimated_delivery_date']
for col in date_columns:
    orders[col] = pd.to_datetime(orders[col])

# Create date features
orders['purchase_date'] = orders['order_purchase_timestamp'].dt.date
orders['purchase_month'] = orders['order_purchase_timestamp'].dt.month
orders['purchase_dayofweek'] = orders['order_purchase_timestamp'].dt.dayofweek

# Merge datasets for comprehensive analysis
order_items_products = pd.merge(order_items, products, on='product_id')
orders_items_products = pd.merge(orders, order_items_products, on='order_id')
```

The full data processing pipeline included:

* Data cleaning to handle missing values
* Feature engineering to create meaningful date-based attributes
* Dataset joins to connect orders with products, customers, and sellers
* Aggregation to calculate daily, weekly, and monthly metrics

## Visualizations & Insights

### Daily Active Users

**Insights:**

* The e-commerce platform has shown consistent user growth over the analyzed period
* Weekly patterns are evident with higher activity on weekdays
* Marketing campaigns (annotated) produced significant spikes in user activity

### Sales Trends

**Insights:**

* Revenue shows a steady upward trend with seasonal variations
* The 7-day moving average helps identify the underlying growth pattern
* Peak sales periods correlate with promotional events and holidays

### Conversion Rate

**Insights:**

* Average conversion rate of 32.5% is strong for e-commerce
* Checkout UX improvements implemented mid-period resulted in a measurable 3% increase
* Conversion rate stability indicates consistent user experience

### Product Category Performance

**Insights:**

* Furniture, electronics, and clothing are the top-performing categories
* The top category generates 3x more revenue than the second-best category
* High-value items (furniture) drive revenue while lower-cost items (clothing) drive order volume

### Customer Retention

**Insights:**

* Monthly retention rate improved from 22% to 33% over the analyzed period
* New customer acquisition shows healthy growth
* The loyalty program launched in the most recent month contributed to improved retention

### Delivery Time

**Insights:**

* Average delivery time decreased from 12 days to 9.6 days (20% improvement)
* The implementation of a new logistics partner in the middle of the period had a measurable positive impact
* Faster delivery correlates with improved customer retention

## Comprehensive Dashboard

## Interactive Dashboard

I also developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows stakeholders to:

* Filter data by date range
* Adjust the moving average window for trend analysis
* Toggle annotations for key events
* Explore detailed metrics across different tabs

## Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I developed these actionable recommendations:

1. **Category Investment**: Increase inventory and marketing for the furniture category, which shows the highest average order value.
2. **Logistics Optimization**: Continue optimizing the delivery process as delivery time improvements correlate with higher retention rates.
3. **Loyalty Program Expansion**: Expand the loyalty program that has contributed to improved retention rates.
4. **Marketing Campaign Timing**: Schedule marketing campaigns to coincide with natural dips in the weekly sales cycle to maintain more consistent revenue.
5. **UX Improvements**: Invest in additional checkout and product page UX improvements as they demonstrate measurable impacts on conversion rates.

## Technical Implementation

This project was built using:

* **Python**: For data processing and analysis
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For static visualizations
* **Plotly**: For interactive charts
* **Streamlit**: For the interactive dashboard

The analysis follows a modular approach to ensure maintainability and reproducibility:

1. Data acquisition and cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Metric calculation
4. Visualization generation
5. Dashboard integration

## Conclusion

This product performance dashboard project demonstrates how data analysis can provide actionable insights for e-commerce businesses. By tracking key metrics and visualizing them effectively, I was able to identify areas of success and opportunities for improvement.

The analysis revealed positive trends in user growth, conversion rates, and delivery times, while also highlighting the importance of category management and customer retention strategies.
